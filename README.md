## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm or Yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/eduplatform.git](https://github.com/your-username/eduplatform.git)
    cd eduplatform
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Create `.env.local` file:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add your JWT secret:
    ```
    JWT_SECRET=YOUR_VERY_STRONG_AND_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY_HERE_MIN_32_CHARS
    ```
    **Important:** Replace `YOUR_VERY_STRONG_AND_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY_HERE_MIN_32_CHARS` with a long, random string. This is crucial for security.

4.  **(Optional) Add SF Pro Display Fonts:**
    For the exact "Apple-like" font, you'd need to legally obtain "SF Pro Display" fonts and place `SF-Pro-Display-Regular.otf`, `SF-Pro-Display-Medium.otf`, `SF-Pro-Display-Bold.otf` inside the `public/fonts/` directory. If you don't have them, the project will gracefully fall back to system sans-serif fonts defined in `tailwind.config.js`.

### Running the Development Server

To run the project in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
